In my Android application developed for Flower Moon Nursery, I crafted a comprehensive platform with distinct pages tailored for seamless purchasing experiences. Each page caters to specific needs, offering options for seeds, equipment, indoor plants, and outdoor plants. Additionally, I integrated essential features such as a calculator for easy calculations and an "About Us" page to provide insights into the nursery's background and mission. The activity page serves as a hub for users, facilitating smooth navigation across the application. Notably, the purchasing page stands out with its detailed input fields for user information, ensuring a personalized shopping journey. Users can add items to their carts or proceed with purchases, with the added convenience of tracking their orders until delivery. Through this project, showcased on my LinkedIn profile, I underscore my proficiency in developing user-centric applications that streamline processes and enhance user satisfaction.
